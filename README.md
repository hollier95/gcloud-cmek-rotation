# Automated Disk Reencryption Script for Virtual Machines

This Bash script automates the reencryption process for disks attached to running virtual machines within a Google Cloud project. The reencryption is carried out using Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to ensure data security.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. **Google Cloud Environment**: Make sure you have an active project in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where the resources (virtual machines, disks, KMS keys, etc.) that the script will manage are located.

2. **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)**: The script employs `gcloud` commands to interact with Google Cloud services. Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed and have configured your account for access to the relevant project. You should be logged in to your Google Cloud account by running `gcloud auth login`.

3. **KMS Key and Version**: You should have already created a keyring and key in Google Cloud KMS. The names of the keyring and key should match the values specified in the script (`KEYRING` and `KEY`). Additionally, ensure that at least one version of this key exists.

4. **Running Virtual Machines**: The script is designed to manage the disks of running virtual machines. Make sure you have active virtual machines in your project.

## Using the Script

1. Copy the script into a file with a `.sh` extension, e.g., `reencrypt-disks.sh`.

2. Open a command line or terminal.

3. Make sure you're logged in to your Google Cloud account by running `gcloud auth login`.

4. Navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

5. Provide execution permission to the script using the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x reencrypt-disks.sh
   ```

6. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   ./reencrypt-disks.sh
   ```

Ensure that you comprehend the actions that the script will execute on your resources. Customize the script to suit your specific needs before running it. A comprehensive understanding of the operations performed by the script is crucial to prevent any undesired outcomes.
